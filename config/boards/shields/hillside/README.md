See [github/mmccoyd](https://github.com/mmccoyd/hillside/) for the board description.

The default keymap follows that in QMK and is described
  [there](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/handwired/hillside).

The following must be manually enabled in the hillside.conf:
- Encoders
- Underglow

If desired, you could hardware a display to the I2C header
  that is provided for a haptic feedback board.
