See [github](https://github.com/mmccoyd/hillside/) for the board description.



The following must be manually enabled in the hillside.conf if desired:
- Encoders
- Underglow


The hardware has an I2C header for haptic feedback and mounts for a trackball.
But these are not supported in ZMK.
Handwiring could use that I2C header for a display.
